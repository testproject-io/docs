# Web sites with CAPTCHA

﻿Selenium can't handle captcha.\
﻿Web sites use captcha so no one can automate them.\
﻿You can ask your developers to provide you with a special environment where they bypass that captcha feature or expose the captcha value on the DOM so you can get the value of the captcha during run time.

The whole idea behind a **CAPTCHA** (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is that you won’t be able to automate it.

If your developers will create some sort of a workaround for you, you will be able to avoid the captcha.
