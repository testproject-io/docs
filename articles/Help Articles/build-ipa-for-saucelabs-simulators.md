# Build IPA for SauceLabs simulators

When you are working with TestProject, you don't upload the files to SauceLabs directly.\
﻿You create and upload an application to TestProject and we accept ZIPs and IPAs.\
﻿\
﻿To create an IPA, you have to build an App for a simulator, e.g.

And not a device:

Then you can use the Window > Organizer menu and prepare the App build for distribution.\
﻿This will prepare an IPA file for you wherever you will choose on your computer.\
﻿\
﻿This IPA needs to be uploaded to **TestProject**.\
﻿We will make sure to upload the App to SauceLabs before the test is executed.
