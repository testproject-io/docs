# Copy of v0.63

### New Features and Improvements

* **One Agent For All My Accounts!** - Some of our users have more than one TestProject account for various purposes. We've made it really simple to use the same agent across these accounts. If you have an agent running, logging into either of your accounts on that machine will provide you with an option to easily associate the agent with the current account.
* **Reusability Is Key** - Once you record your test, in some cases you will want/need to refactor it to achieve a more structured test design and improve future maintenance. For example, you will want your **Login** steps to be in a separate test which will handle your login flow for all your other tests. This way, if something changes in your login logic, you will only have one place to update. For this reason, we've introduced the **Group Steps** feature! Simply select the steps that you want to group into a separated test, click the **group** icon, give your new test a name and that's it. All the selected steps will be replaced with a single one which will now execute the new nested test. If any of the steps were using parameters, they will be automatically created in the nested test and all the values from the parent test will be mapped there.

* **Default Screenshot Behavior** - In addition to the existing option of setting a screenshot behavior of each step, we've added the option of setting default behavior on a test level. Go to test settings and choose the behavior that you desire. Each new step will be created using this default setting unless you choose otherwise for specific steps. By default screenshots will only be taken if a step fails as the images will use up your account storage. Please note that if you have tests that were created prior to this feature, each step will have its own setting.

* **I Want Another One Just Like It** - In some cases, it can be a good idea to duplicate an entire project. For example, this comes in handy when you are upgrading your application and still need to support and maintain a legacy version. You can now easily duplicate a project and start from there. When you duplicate a project, all of its entities will be duplicated alongside with it (tests, jobs, apps, data sources, etc.).

* **Report Email Notifications** - Following a request from the community, we've added a **PASS/FAIL** label to the job report email notification subject. This allows to see if your job passed or failed without the need to open the email.

### Agent & SDKs

![](https://storage-static.testproject.io/release-notes/0.63/python-logo.png)

*   **Python SDK** - After great anticipation, we've released our [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/testproject-python-sdk/). You can now enjoy all the perks of TestProject with your favorite automation language. &#x20;

    Read more about the new SDK in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/testproject-io/python-sdk) and in [the docs](https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/python-sdk). In addition to that, check out this [great blog post](https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/) from [Bas Dijkstra](https://blog.testproject.io/author/basdijkstra/).

To use it just run this:

```
pip install testproject-python-sdk
```

* **Brand new Java SDK** - In addition to our Python SDK, we've released a new version of our Java SDK. In short, this version is much simpler and easier to use. In addition, you are no longer required to download the SDK and attach it as a dependency as we've moved it to a [Maven Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.testproject/java-sdk). Read more about the new SDK in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/testproject-io/java-sdk) and in [the docs](https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/java-sdk). In addition to that, check out the official announcement in this [blog post](https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/14/announcing-testproject-new-opensdk/).

To use it just add this to your _**pom.xml**_:

```markup
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.testproject</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-sdk</artifactId>
  <version>0.63.3-RELEASE</version>
  <classifier>sources</classifier>
</dependency>
```

or this to your _**build.gradle**_ if you use Gradle:

```
implementation 'io.testproject:java-sdk:0.63.3-RELEASE'
```

* **Local Execution** - The new Python and Java SDK also have a new capability allowing you to run your tests without uploading them to TestProject and still take advantage of TestProject's advanced reporting capabilities. Read more [here](https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/java-sdk#tests-reports) for Java, [here](https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/python-sdk#test-reports) for Python and [here](https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/c-sdk#tests-reports) for C#.
* **What Browsers?** - From now on, you don't need to take care of anything! The TestProject agent will automatically keep track of available browsers. This means that if you install a new browser on your computer, it will appear in TestProject after a short time without the need to restart the agent.

### API

* **Latest Agent Execution** - We've enhanced the [existing **Latest Report** endpoint](https://api.testproject.io/docs/v2/#/Reports/Reports\_GetV2ProjectsByProjectIdJobsByJobIdReportsLatest) and added an optional _**agentId**_ parameter. Providing this parameter will return the latest execution of the job that was executed on the specific agent. This is most useful in case you are running the same job in parallel on multiple agents.
* **Devices and Emulators** - The [GET devices](https://api.testproject.io/docs/v2/#/Jobs/Jobs\_GetJobPhysicalDevices) will now return only physical devices. To get a list of defined emulators please use the [GET emulators](https://api.testproject.io/docs/v2/#/Jobs/Jobs\_GetJobEmulatorDevices) endpoint. Use [this](https://api.testproject.io/docs/v2/#/Jobs/Jobs\_UpdateJobPhysicalDevicesAsync) endpoint to update job devices and [this one](https://api.testproject.io/docs/v2/#/Jobs/Jobs\_UpdateJobEmulatorsAsync) to update emulators.
