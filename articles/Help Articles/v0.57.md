### New Features and Improvements

* A Brand New Monitor - The formally **Job Monitor** was redesigned from the ground up to provide a real-time picture of all your past, present and future automation activities. Among other cool stuff you will find some basic statistics, previous executions and all the upcoming jobs that are scheduled to run. In addition to the real-time info, we've added simple shortcuts for you to quickly see reports, re-run tests and jobs in one click and many other cool additions. In addition to that hovering over the **Monitor** top menu will provide you with a quick glance on current and upcoming executions.

* **Web Element explorer** - We've all come to know and love the [mobile element explorer](https://docs.testproject.io/using-the-smart-test-recorder/finding-and-using-elements/element-explorer) that is available in the TestProject recorder since [version 0.49](https://docs.testproject.io/releases/v0.49#new-features). We are happy to say that following several requests from the community we've added the same great explorer for web applications as well. You are welcome to use it to better inspect elements and [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document\_Object\_Model) structure in your web tests like you are used to in Mobile.
* **Easy Job Scheduling** - We've made job scheduling easier than ever! Click on the ![](https://storage-static.testproject.io/release-notes/0.57/Scheduler.png) to directly open the job scheduler. Choose **On Demand** for to disable scheduling, **One Time** to schedule a single future execution or **Recurring** to run your job multiple times in the future. When the job is scheduled, the icon will be colored and hovering over it will show you when the next execution is due. By the way, scheduled jobs can still be triggered manually or using the [API](https://api.testproject.io/docs/v2/#/).
* **Job info** - We've updated the job list information. You can now clearly see how many **tests** & **browsers**/**devices** the job has alongside with the designated agent. Hover over to see the list of defined **browsers**/**devices**.

* **Critical Tests** - We've added a useful new feature to our jobs. You can now define what happens if a test in your job fails. Just click on the \[ICON] to set test behavior in a job. By default, if the test fails the job will continue to the next test in line. You can also choose to skip all other tests and continue to the next browser/device or to entirely abort job execution. If a test has other than default definition, it will be indicated with a respective color strip on the left of the test (hover over it to see some info).
