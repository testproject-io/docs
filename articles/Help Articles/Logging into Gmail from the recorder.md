# Logging into Gmail from the recorder

If you're being blocked from logging into your Gmail account with the below error:​

​

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (470).png>)

You need to log into any other website that uses the "Log in with Google" feature.

​\
Open a different website you are familiar with that allows logging into it or sign up with Google, such as:

\
[https://stackoverflow.com/](https://stackoverflow.com)

And sign up or log in with the Gmail account you'd like to access.

​

And then, you will be able to return to and log in to your Gmail account.

Note: If this doesn't work, your account might have been created before Google changed certain permissions, and you will need to create a new Gmail account to use in your test.
