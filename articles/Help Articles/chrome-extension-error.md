# Chrome Extension Error

The extension itself doesn't need to be installed from the market, moreover, it's not available on the market.\
﻿The extension gets installed automatically once you run the recorder tool or execute a test.\
﻿At any other moment, it is detached from the browser.

The error you see is related to administrator rights on the machine, and the system administrator has blocked the possibility to install software or make any changes to the computer, so the extension can't be loaded and it fails to run the recording.

TestProject's Chrome extension ID is: kofgdekdngefnkdjlojpodcfkbegjemo
