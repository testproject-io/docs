# What counts as storage space?

The storage in TestProject is used for:&#x20;

1. **Screenshots**: Test execution report screenshots that are taken by default for failed steps only (you can manually edit when to take screenshots).
2. **Coded tests** binaries&#x20;
3. **Application APK/IPA** binaries (only in cases when they are uploaded to the platform).
4. **Data Sources** (only in cases when they are uploaded to the platform).
5. **Addons** (only in cases when you uploaded your own Addons to the platform).

You can manage your storage by deleting old items (such as report screenshots).&#x20;

However, in case you have reached the storage limit of 2GB and cannot delete any items - Feel free to reach out to the team and we will upgrade your account with up to 10GB for free according to our policy.&#x20;

Happy Testing!
