**Here are the basic prerequisites and steps needed to start recording on iOS simulators**

• Mac computer and macOS operating system.

• TestProject Agent to be [installed ](https://intercom.help/testprojectio/getting-started/installation-and-setup)and running on your computer.

• Xcode to be installed from [Mac App Store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1\&mt=12)

To create a new simulator on Xcode go to Windows -> Devices and Simulators:

For this moment you can simply follow the new test creation flow in TestProject and select one of the simulators as you do for physical devices to start recording your automated tests. after you create a simulator just search your application from the installed application list:

**Important Clarification** - for start recording tests on iOS simulators you don't need to own apple developer account or create a provisioning profile as you required for physical devices .
