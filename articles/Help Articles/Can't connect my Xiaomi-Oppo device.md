# Can't connect my Xiaomi/Oppo device

In Xiaomi/Oppo devices, there is an extra layer of security that you need to enable in the developer option in order to connect your device and work with TestProject.

1. Enable the "USB debugging (security option)" option. To do this, you will need to have a SIM card in your device.
2. Enable the "Install via USB" option
3. Try going to the device settings and Disabling Permission Monitoring**.**
4. If none of the above helped you, try to disable the "MIUI Optimization" option
