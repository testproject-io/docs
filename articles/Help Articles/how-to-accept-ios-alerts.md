I have also added the capabilities I used here:

```json
{  "platformName": "iOS",  "platformVersion": "14.5",  "deviceName": "iPhone",  "udid": "00008030-000C71643EA1802E",  "bundleId": "com.waze.iphone",  "autoAcceptAlerts": "true"}
```

Don't forget to change the version and device UDID according to your environment.
