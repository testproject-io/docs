# Why am I getting "Operation failed, please try again" when trying to record web test?

If you are trying to start recording a web test and you are getting this error message that says "Operation failed, please try again", it might be related to your Chrome version.&#x20;

When a new Chrome version is released, we also update the Chromedriver version to match the new Chrome version.\
So, when you get this error message, check your Chrome version and update it if needed.
