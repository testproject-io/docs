# Sharing multiple tests in TestProject

If you want to share tests in TestProject there are multiple options to do so we will elaborate on how to share a single test and how to share **multiple** tests.

### **Share a single test** <a href="#h_55f496b1e6" id="h_55f496b1e6"></a>

#### 1) Use a direct link or email <a href="#h_575834da7f" id="h_575834da7f"></a>

Can be done by clicking on the context menu of the test --> share test:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (557).png>)

1\) We can share a link to the test using the email field.

2\) We can share the direct link.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (455).png>)

#### 2) Share your test as a file <a href="#h_503e0637f5" id="h_503e0637f5"></a>

We can save our test as a file:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (466) (1).png>)

We can share the file using any platform we choose.

### **Share multiple tests** <a href="#h_65873064d7" id="h_65873064d7"></a>

#### Use a project to share multiple tests <a href="#h_0008a597f8" id="h_0008a597f8"></a>

To share multiple tests we can simply follow these steps:

a) Duplicate a project in our account.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (479) (1).png>)

b) Remove or keep the tests we want to share.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (556).png>)

c) We can change the name of the project to Shared tests for instance.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (469) (1).png>)

d) Invite the user to our account.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (452).png>)

e) Give the user permissions to the project:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (481).png>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (480).png>)

#### Share multiple tests using subtests <a href="#h_e314b18317" id="h_e314b18317"></a>

To share multiple tests as we can use nested tests first we will create a new test. now let's edit the test and use the following button to add all the tests we would like to share:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (517).png>)

We are going to "SAVE & EXIT" and now we can simply share this test as a file a direct link or via email. any subtest inside the test we shared will be saved in the file or will be available to the user when sharing

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (492) (1).png>)
