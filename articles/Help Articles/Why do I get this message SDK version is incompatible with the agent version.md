# Why do I get this message: "SDK version is incompatible with the agent version"

If you are working with the Java SDK and creating addons or coded tests, you might get this error in your console:

```java
"java.lang.RuntimeException: Your SDK version is incompatible with this Agent, please use a newer version"
```

As this error says, you must update your SDK version to the latest one. Every time we release a major version (0.58, 0.59, etc.), a new SDK version is also released with a matching version number. So, simply download the new SDK version from [here](https://app.testproject.io/#/integrations/sdk?lang=Java) and replace it with the existing one in your machine.
