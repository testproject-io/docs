# Can I use a test inside another test? (Nested Tests)

Combining a test inside another test, can really simplify your test maintenance. Instead of having an enormous test with hundreds of steps, you can create separate tests as your building blocks and then, combine them into one master test.

To add a test as a step inside a bigger test, you need to create a new step manually. Click on the "+" icon:

If the test that you want to add has parameters in it, you will be presented with a pop-up window that will ask you if you would like to add those parameters into your main test.
