# Getting Ready to Use an SDK

TestProject has several powerful SDKs in different languages. Before you get started with them, though, there are a few things you need to have in place:

* If you not yet have a TestProject account, you will need [register](https://app.testproject.io/signup/) for one. And don't worry, TestProject accounts are free to setup and will stay free forever! If you already have an account,  make sure you are logged in to your account at [https://app.testproject.io/](https://app.testproject.io).
* [Download](https://app.testproject.io/#/download) and install an Agent for your operating system or pull a container from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/testproject/agent).
* Run the Agent and [register](https://docs.testproject.io/getting-started/installation-and-setup#register-the-agent) it with your Account. If you already have an agent installed make sure it is currently running on your machine.
* Get a development token from [Integrations / SDK](https://app.testproject.io/#/integrations/sdk) page.

Once you have all these prerequisites in place, you are ready to setup the SDK that you want to use. Currently TestProject supports [Java](../opensdk-v2/java-sdk/), [Python ](../opensdk-v2/python-sdk.md)and [C#](broken-reference) SDKs.&#x20;
