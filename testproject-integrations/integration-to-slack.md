# Slack Integration

Slack is a powerful communication tool used by many companies. Test Project can easily integrate with Slack allowing you to get notifications and information about your test automation runs directly in a slack channel.

## Adding Slack Integration to TestProject

After logging into your TestProject account, go to the Integrations tab and click on the Web Hooks + Slack option

Click the ![](https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/add\_to\_slack.png) icon and you will be redirected to the Slack authorization page.

After the redirect you will need to choose the team and a channel where your TestProject notifications will be sent to (_You will be asked to login into your Slack team account if you were not already logged in_). Choose to “Authorize” and you will be redirected back to the “Integrations” section of your TestProject account settings. You will now see a Slack integration entry containing the name of your slack team and the channel for the integration.

## Sending TestProject Job Notifications to Slack

After setting up Slack integration and authorizing a designated channel, notifications can be sent. Simply navigate to a project that has jobs setup and click on the _envelope_ icon of your job of choice to open the notifications preferences. You can then Enable Web Hooks and select the Slack integration you want to use.

This is it! You will now receive a well formatted job execution summary in Slack after the job completes its execution. Here is an example of such a notification for a “Sanity” job that was executed on Chrome and IE browsers and contained 2 tests. The notification also contains a direct link to the generated TestProject report.
