* Added the option to open a test inside a test.
* Added test 'breadcrumbs' for easy navigation between tests.
* Updated test visuals and icons.

As usual to edit the test as a step, click on it and navigate to the advanced options. In addition from now on, you can also go into subtests using the 'pencil' (Edit test) option.

#### iOS Provisioning profile automatic reminder

When uploading a provisioning profile we will take a timestamp and remind you to renew it before it's expired. If you encounter an alert to renew your provisioning profile please do so as fast as possible to prevent issues related to iOS recording/execution in your automation framework.

![Find the expiration date on your iOS settings page](<../.gitbook/assets/image (462) (1).png>)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Outdated provisioning profiles cannot be used for recording or execution.
{% endhint %}

#### Appium 2.0 is out!

Due to high demand from the community, we have made changes in the Agent to support Appium 2.0. Starting this version, Appium is following W3C guidelines for locators, thus you now need to make sure your mobile executions are ready for 3.4.0 as described [**here**](https://intercom.help/testprojectio/en/articles/5748260-fix-invalid-argument-invalid-locator-error-on-agent-3-4-0-appium-2-0).

#### Headless Edge is here

Starting 3.4.0 the Agent supports automatic detection and execution of headless Edge. This feature includes all of your local Agents and Docker Agents as well.

#### Other improvements:

* Test Re-runs have been enabled on Virtual Agents.
