# v3.4.0

## New Features and Improvements



#### Appium 2.0 is out!

Due to high demand from the community, we have made changes in the Agent to support Appium 2.0. Starting this version, Appium is following W3C guidelines for locators, thus you now need to make sure your mobile executions are ready for 3.4.0 as described [here](https://intercom.help/testprojectio/en/articles/5748260-fix-invalid-argument-invalid-locator-error-on-agent-3-4-0-appium-2-0).

#### Headless Edge is here

Starting 3.4.0 the Agent supports automatic detection and execution of headless Edge. This feature includes all of your local Agents and Docker Agents as well.
