# v3.3.0

## New Features and Improvements

#### New healing capability with Test Re-Run! ****

Due to high demand from the community, you can now re-run failed tests in a Job in order to automatically heal the job.

* You can now re-run tests up to 5 times, each acts as an additional iteration in case the test fails.
* In case one of the additional re-runs passes, the job will be healed and marked as passed \(with the healing icon in the report\).

#### Web and UI:

* **Optimized execution reporting** and Job initialization to better reflect Agent tasks when executing tests. The Agent now reports execution progress in the Monitor section, such as: Downloading App, Data sources, Tests and more.

* **New Agent Overlay** - You asked for it we made it! On the top right corner, you will now have access to everything you need to know about your local Agent: from managing workers, viewing all connected devices, and monitoring local test executions - all in one click!

**Testing on New Operating System Versions**

* **iOS 15 is supported** - Apple just had their official annual event, announcing among others their new OS version: iOS 15. We're ready just in time with support for the latest version, so you can kick-off your iOS testing to its fullest power, and make sure your apps run smoothly on the new OS version!

**Agent Registration:**
