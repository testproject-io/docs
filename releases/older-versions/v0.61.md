# v0.61

### New Features and Improvements

* **qTest Integration** - We are excited to announce the latest in a series of recent integrations. TestProject will now be integrated directly to [qTest](https://www.qasymphony.com/software-testing-tools/qtest-manager/test-case-management/), the #1 cloud test management tool. Now, TestProject users have the option to easily integrate a powerful, enterprise ready test management tool with their existing test automation processes. You can read more in this [blog post](https://blog.testproject.io/2020/03/20/qtest-testproject-open-source-nirvana/) and take a look at a recent [webinar](https://blog.testproject.io/2020/03/31/testproject-and-qtest-integration-webinar/) that we had on the subject.\

* **Performance Boost** - TestProject is all about making it easy for our users. We are constantly improving the platform to save you time and make your work with the platform as easy and smooth as possible. In this version we’ve introduced major platform enhancements to increase usability and make things go faster. This is not the end of it as we will continue to do so to make it even faster.\

* **Docker Agents** - We’ve all came to love Docker in the recent years as it became the #1 go-to solution for easy scalable lightweight virtual containers. From now on, each released version of our Agent is also released to our [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/testproject/agent). With TestProject Agents running in Docker containers you can easily setup a virtual lab to run you tests in parallel and make your test cycles more extensive and shorter at the same time.\

* **Job Behavior** - We’ve added a cool new feature to allow you to control what happens between the various tests in your TestProject jobs. When creating/updating a job, you can now choose whether the browser restarts between each test in the job or not. For mobile jobs this feature controls if the application is restarted before each test.

> By default, the browser/application will not restart between each test.

### Addons

* **Mobile Extensions** – We’ve added some additional actions to the already great [Mobile Extensions Addon](https://addons.testproject.io/mobile-extensions). Among others, you can find the new **Get package name** and the **Install app/Uninstall app** actions.

### Agent & SDKs

* **Test/Project Parameters** - Our [Java](https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/java-sdk)/[C#](https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/c-sdk) SDKs now have the option to use execution parameters. Just use the following in your tests/addons to get/add/remove parameters in run time.

```java
helper.GetContext().ExecutionParameters
```

### API

* **Data Sources** – We’ve added all the necessary endpoints to manage the data sources (CSV) files of your projects through our API. You can see all the new methods [here](https://api.testproject.io/docs/v2/#/DataSources).\

* **Job Management** – Following the support for browser/application restart that we’ve added in the application, it is now also possible to control this behavior of a job using the _**restartDriver**_ property when creating/updating a job.\

* **Docker Configuration** – With the new dockerized Agents we’ve added a new endpoint to the [Agents API](https://api.testproject.io/docs/v2/#/Agents) that allows you to generate a configuration for seamlessly registering agents when spinning up a new [Docker Agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/testproject/agent).\

* **PDF Reports** – It is now possible to get job reports in a PDF format. The document is the same one you are used to. Just select _**format=PDF**_ in the API call. You will get a response containing the link to the generated report.
