# v2.3

### New Features and Improvements

**Bring it Back!** - If you've previously recorded a test using the TestProject recorder and saved it to a file or you've exported an existing one to a file, you can now upload this file back to the TestProject cloud. Having your test in the cloud allows you for example to benefit from the seamless team collaboration and automated CI flows.

**Enhanced Mobile Recorder** - Our best of breed mobile recorder now has the known and loved UI just like the web recorder does. It has been built with new technologies and includes a bunch of improvements to allow smoother and much more efficient workflows.

**What went wrong?!** - If you run heavy jobs, this one is for you! When reviewing job execution reports, you can now choose to display only the failed tests to allow quicker troubleshooting. This functionality joins the existing option to display only failed steps in each test.

**Connect to Remote Agents with OpenSDK** - Distributed execution for test automation has never been easier. Using our OpenSDK, you can create a grid and execute tests across multiple desired targets & various combinations.
