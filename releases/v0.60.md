# v0.60

### New Features and Improvements

* **Sauce Labs and BrowserStack Integration** - We are happy to announce that [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) and 

  [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) integration is now available in TestProject! 

  * Sauce Labs allows users to run tests in the cloud on 1,000's of different browsers, operating systems and device combinations, providing a comprehensive test infrastructure for automated and manual testing of web and mobile applications using Selenium, Appium and JavaScript unit testing frameworks. 
  * BrowserStack is a cloud web and mobile testing platform that enables you to test your websites and mobile applications across on-demand browsers, operating systems and real mobile devices, without requiring users to install or maintain an internal lab of virtual machines, devices or emulators. Users can choose from more than 1,200 on-demand real mobile devices, browsers and operating systems and rely on a secure, stable and scalable infrastructure to support thousands of concurrent manual and automated tests. 

* **Headless Browsers** - From now on, if you have a Chrome or Firefox browser installed, you can execute your tests in a "headless" mode. By the way, if you run your agents in a "headless" Linux machine, your web tests will run in this mode automatically. When running a test or configuring jobs, just select the desired "headless" browsers from the list.

> In order to use the "headless" option, the full browser needs to be installed on the agent machine.

* **Something is Running** - We've added a cool indicator to let you know if something is running in your account. You will see a blinking blue dot on the **Monitor** menu when one of your tests or jobs are being executed.

* **Enhanced Browser Support** - From now on, TestProject Agents will automatically load the correct Selenium driver based on the version of the targeted browser. This means that if a new browser version comes out, you will no longer have to worry about it and we will even support some of the beta versions to allow you to better prepare your applications for the upcoming browser releases. We still recommend to always upgrade your agents to the latest available version to enjoy all the greatest and latest features.

### Fixes

* **Agents** - Agent registration was failing in some rare cases.
* **Execution** – Agents will no longer open Appium settings screen before each Android test run.
* **Jobs** – Minor UI fixes in the jobs list.
* **Monitor** – Added progress indication for coded tests that report steps using the SDK reporter.
* **Recorder** – Eliminated hanging issues for some iOS applications.
* **Reports** – Fixed incorrect result stats of coded test.
* **Reports** – When deleting several reports at once, the reports were not always deleted.
* **SDK** - Parameters defined in base class will now populate with the default value in Java SDK.

### Known Issues

* Trying to execute web tests inside of mobile jobs while targeting Sauce Labs devices will fail to run. Executing on local devices will run as expected as well as running a single web test on a Sauce Labs device.
