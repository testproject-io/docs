# v0.51

### New Features and Improvements

* Code Generation - A brand new feature for generating Java source code from existing recorded tests. Accessible via the test's context menu, as the _**"Generate Code"**_ option.  


  The process may take up to a few minutes. Once completed, an email with a download link will be sent to the user that requested the code generation.  


  The generated package contains a complete Gradle project that can be executed without any additional setup.  


  Additional information is available in this [blog post](https://blog.testproject.io/2019/03/28/export-recorded-tests-to-java-with-testproject/).

* Dynamic Elements - We've added support for integrating Test/Project Parameters as part of an Element's location strategy.  


  For example, a label with an ID that depends on a runtime value \(e.g. Username\), can now be located using the following XPATH: **//label\[@id='user\_USERNAME\_PARAM'\]**.

* iOS Goodies - Improved in-browser performance for screen mirroring on iOS 11+ devices, and support for iOS 12.2.
* Report Enhancements - Additional information about the element that was used in a step is now visible in the execution report.  This allows easier troubleshooting of failed executions \(in case of dynamic elements, the value will contain the final, parsed expression\).

### Fixes

* In some rare cases, the SDK v2 _typeText\(\)_ method did not function as expected.
* Validation inside a step is now displayed correctly.
* Long application names is now displayed correctly during edit.
* When deleting an in-use parameter\(s\), dependencies are now displayed correctly.
* In some cases, the Test Recorder's Spy menu automatically closed while searching for actions.
* There's no longer a missing _value_ attribute when inspecting iOS elements.
* _IsSelected?_ action now works on iOS tests.
* There's no longer an error in step validations when values contain special HTML escape characters.
* In some cases, _Scroll_ steps were not recorded correctly for Web tests.
* Some iOS devices were not detected by the TestProject Agent from time to time.
