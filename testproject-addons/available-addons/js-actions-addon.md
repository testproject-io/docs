# JS Actions Addon

The JS Actions addon gives you access to some basic UI actions like clicking, context clicking or typing in text though javascript. Sometimes webdriver clicks or typing commands can't be used and in that case this addon lets you manipulate the UI. An example that shows this addon in action, can be found [here](../../articles/tips-and-tricks/expanding-ui-automation-capabilities-with-javascript.md).
