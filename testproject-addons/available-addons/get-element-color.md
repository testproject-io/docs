# Get Element Color

## Description&#x20;

With this addon, you will be able to extract the [RGB ](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors\_rgb.asp)value that represents the dominant color of an element/screenshot in Web as well as **Android and IOS**, and if required, to compare with an expected result.

## Web and Mobile

Hover over the element ith TestProject recorder, press double shift, then search for **Get Color **action

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (288).png>)

You can also input the expected result and compare the desired color&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (290).png>)

The Action will pass if both RGB values are equal, and will fail either wise.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (291).png>)

The output will return the dominant color of the element/image.

## Get Color From Local Image&#x20;

You can utilize the "Get Color From Local Image" action to read the dominant color from locally saved image&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (289).png>)

The evaluation and result are the same as the element actions, the difference is the source of the image and the type is **Action**.
