# Create a Test Step

Test steps are one of the fundamental building blocks of a test. This section will cover some of the details involved in creating test steps.

## Smart Recorder

The easiest way to create test steps is with the Smart Recorder. This powerful recorder makes creating a test step as easy as clicking on the elements on a page. When you pair this ease of use with the self-healing technology that is built into the Smart Recorder it's a no-brainer to use. 

The Smart Recorder can handle almost any testing scenario you throw at it. For example, if you have dynamic elements with IDs that change each time the page loads, the Smart Recorder will dynamically respond to it and find the correct element for you. It can also seamlessly handle iFrames,  and hoover by automatically taking care of all the complexity of finding elements like that without you needing to anything extra. 

Smart Recorder commands like `Click if Visible` allow you to easily handle popups that may only be there at certain times and the adaptive wait functionality uses the power of AI to solve the common wait frustrations that may test engineers face. The Smart Recorder will also work across multiple tabs and windows, passing along test data and state as it does so. 

This is an impressive list of features \(if we do say so ourselves\) and we are confident that the Smart Recorder will give you the power to create tests that do exactly what you need them to. When creating test steps we would certainly recommend that you use the Smart Recorder. It does all of those work for you automatically in the background, but it never hurts to know what is going on under the hood, so feel free to check out the [Steps Widget ](steps-widget.md)article which highlights the many features that are accesible when creating a test step.
