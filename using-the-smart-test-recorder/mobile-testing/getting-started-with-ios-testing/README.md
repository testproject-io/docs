# Getting started with iOS testing

TestProject enables you to run iOS test automation on any operating system, and even on Windows, [without the need for macOS or Xcode](https://blog.testproject.io/2018/06/11/ios-test-windows-without-mac/) using iOS physical devices.

We also provide support for automating iOS Apps on Xcode simulators using Mac computers and macOS.
